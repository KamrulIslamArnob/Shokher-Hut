# Shokher-Hut (An IoT based smart Cow Selling System during Eid al-Adha)

The "Shokher Hut" project is an innovative IoT-based Cow Selling System aimed at revolutionizing the process of buying and selling cows in Bangladesh during the auspicious occasion of Eid al-Adha. This project integrates cutting-edge electronic features to enhance convenience, safety, and transparency for both buyers and sellers.

# Features

### A. Computerized Hasil Counter

1. **Streamlined and Secure Transactions:** The heart of the "Shokher Hut" Cow Selling System is the advanced "Hasil" counter, which ensures a seamless and secure cow purchasing experience. Cutting-edge technology and user-centric design work together to provide a smooth transaction process, instilling confidence in both buyers and sellers.

2. **Gate Access with Authorization:** The gate access system requires an authorized card, providing a secure passage to the "Hasil" counter. This creates an experience defined by convenience and trust, setting the tone for the entire cow purchasing journey.

3. **Personalized Interaction and Payment Clarity:** Inside the "Hasil" counter, personalized questions guide buyers through cow selection, aligning every detail with their expectations. The payment process is seamlessly integrated, ensuring transparency and creating an irrefutable record within the system's database.

4. **Seamless Exit with Confidence:** After completing the payment, the exit process becomes hassle-free, thanks to synchronized database updates. The gate recognizes the transaction, allowing buyers to confidently guide their purchased cows towards the exit.

### B. Prioritizing Safety and Comfort

1. **Early Fire Detection System:** An advanced fire alarm system with sensitive sensors ensures rapid detection of fire hazards. In case of smoke or sudden temperature increases, the system activates a swift response, alerting operators and initiating preventive measures.

2. **Optimal Temperature Control:** DC motors power an air circulation system equipped with fans, maintaining a favorable temperature within the Cow Hut. This ensures the cows' comfort by regulating airflow and ventilation.

3. **Solar-Powered Shade and Rain Protection:** Solar panel-powered shades harness energy while providing shelter to the cows. These shades transform into protective covers during extreme heat or rain, ensuring the cows' well-being.

### C. The Pick-up Management System

1. **Real-Time Slot Availability Information:** The Pick-up Management System offers real-time tracking of vehicle slots within the Cow Hut premises. Customers and staff receive up-to-the-minute information on parking space availability, eliminating the need to search for a spot.

2. **Effortless Cattle Movement:** The Specialized Cattle Escalator System simplifies cow movement within the facility. This gentle mechanism ensures stress-free transitions between levels, enhancing cow comfort.
